                            Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent 
                            a new nation conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that 
                            all men are created equal &bull;

                            Now we are engaged in a great civil war 
                            testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure &bull; 
                            We are met on a great battle-field of that war &bull; 
                            We have come to dedicate a portion of that field 
                            as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live &bull; 
                            It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this &bull; 
                            But in a larger sense 
                            we can not dedicate ~ we can not consecrate ~ we can not hallow ~ this ground &bull; 
                            The brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it 
                            far above our poor power to add or detract &bull; 
                            The world will little note nor long remember what we say here 
                            but it can never forget what they did here &bull; 
                            It is for us the living rather 
                            to be dedicated here to the unfinished work 
                            which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced &bull; 
                            It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us ~ 
                            that from these honored dead we take increased devotion 
                            to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion ~ 
                            that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain ~ 
                            that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom ~ 
                            and that government of the people by the people for the people 
                            shall not perish from the earth &bull;
